      <p>The questions are 10 and they have three levels of difficulty. The score for each question is based on the level of difficulty.
        The difficulty of the next question is selected based on the current questionâ€™s answer. If you answer correctly,
        the next question would be from a higher level of difficulty. If you answer wrong, then the next one would be easier.
        The first question would be of medium difficulty. During the game, you would know how many questions you answered
        so far and how many are left. At the end of the game, you would see an overall score of your performance
        that will show the list of the questions, if you answered correctly or not, the difficulty, the score for each answer
        and your overall score. You also have the option to save your score using a nickname.</p>
